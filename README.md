# Enhanced-Processor

This repo contains code for a processor with an internal program counter and registers,  external RAM to store instructions and data, and address decoding logic to determine where to write data coming from the processor (either write to the RAM or output registers depending on instruction)

The RAM is initialized with internal instructions defined in the mem init file (*.mif)
